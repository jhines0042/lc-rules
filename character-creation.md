# Character Creation

## Choose your Ancestry, Region, Background, and Starting Guild

Your character is a multifaceted person, who is bringing valuable knowledge and skills from their homeland to this new colony. Mechanically, your character’s Region, Ancestry, Background, and Starting Guild  determine where they come from, what they look like, what their role was back home, and what they are here to contribute to the colony. These choices are perhaps the most important decisions you will make during character creation. 

* Ancestry indicates the family heritage of your character and what, if any, makeup requirements come with that Ancestry. There is no advantage, disadvantage, or skill that is determined by your Ancestry, it simply determines your character’s appearance and some aspects of your roleplay.

* Region determines where your character hails from and what kind of clothing your character prefers as a result. You will also be able to choose one skill from a list of skills specific to your Region to reflect the impact growing up in that Region had on your character.

* Background reflects how your character lived before joining the colony. This will largely be informed by their previous profession, as well as their level and type of education. You will also be able to choose one skill from a list of skills associated with your profession, to reflect aspects of your training and expertise. 

* The Colony of Flint operates under a guild structure, and every colonist is grouped into a guild based on their skills and interests. Every colonist must be sponsored by a guild to travel to Flint, and as such, you will need to choose a guild to join based on what role you wish to play in the colony. You will also be able to choose one of the many skills associated with your chosen guild at the time of character creation. 

## Choose Your Starting Skills

Based on your Region, Background, and starting Guild, you will begin with 3 skills. As your Character advances they will be able to gain new skills from their Region, Background, and Guild assuming they meet the prerequisites. As you pick your Primary Attributes in the next section please ensure that you meet all prerequisites for your chosen starting skills.

## Primary Attributes

Your character has 7 primary attributes, which indicate in a general sense their strengths and weaknesses as a character. The 7 primary attributes are:

*Wits* represent your Character’s intuition, intellect, and problem solving ability. Wits factors into your Character’s Mentals Saves and is a prerequisite for skills that require thinking.

*Strength* represents your Character’s brawn and ability to do physical activity. Strength factors into Hit Points and is a prerequisite for skills that require physical might.

*Essence* represents your Character’s inner self, or “internal spark.” Essence factors into Hit Points and is a prerequisite for skills that interact with the spiritual world. 

*Agility* represents your Character’s deftness, grace, and ability to manipulate delicate components. Agility factors into your Character’s Physical Saves and is a prerequisite for skills that require physical dexterity.

*Resolve* represents your Character’s physical toughness and stamina. Resolve factors into your Character’s Physical Saves and is a prerequisite for skills that require steadfastness of body.

*Focus* represents your Character’s mental toughness and ability to concentrate. Focus factors into your Character’s Mental Saves and is a prerequisite for skills that require mental dedication.

*Harmony* represents your Character’s ability to balance Mind, Body, and Soul. It factors into the Secondary Attribute of Grit.

Each attribute has an automatic baseline of 1 point and you have 20 additional points to distribute amongst these attributes as you see fit for a total of 27. At the time of character creation you may have no more than 7 points total in any one attribute. Keep in mind the kind of person your character is, and what personality traits they have cultivated. You should also reference the list of skills associated with your starting guild, as some have prerequisites that you may want to ensure you can easily meet in the future. 

## Secondary Attributes

Secondary attributes are mechanical elements of your character that are calculated based on your chosen primary attributes. After finalizing your Primary Attributes, calculate your Secondary Attributes using the following formulas. 

*Hit Points* (Strength + Essence) / divided by 2, rounded down 
This is the amount of damage your Character can take before they are incapacitated. 

*Hit Point Cap* (15) 
Your Character’s Ppermanent Hit Points can never exceed this Hit Point Cap.  All Characters have a starting Hit Point Cap of 15.  Scars may increase this cap but never above 20.

*Physical Saves* (Agility + Resolve) / divided by 10, rounded down + 1
These saves counter Hit Point damage and Physical Effects that have successfully targeted you. This includes melee weapon strikes, ranged weapon darts, and spell packets causing physical damage or physical effects. 

*Mental Saves* (Wits + Focus) / divided by 10, rounded down + 1
These saves counter Mental Attacks and Mental Effects delivered within line of sight. 

*Grit* (Harmony) / divided by 5, rounded down + 1 
Spend a Grit point to immediately refresh one skill as though you had rested. Grit points do not refresh because of a Rest, but there are ways to gain Grit Points back. You may not gain Grit Points above your Grit number. 

*Skills* (Primary Attribute Points) / divided by 10, rounded down + 1
This is the number of skills that your Character can know.  Scars may increase this number.

# Regions

Every PC started their life living on the continent of Sobukand.  Sobukand is currently run as a single empire lead by two empresses.  Before the empire was founded however the land was divided into various kingdoms and the borders of these kingdoms at the formation of the empire were essentially preserved.  These former kingdoms are now called provinces in the official documentation of the empire, but for the purpose of Character creation we call them Regions.  Below you will find the relevant information needed for Character creation.  For more detailed information on an individual Region, please see the supplemental Region Guides available on our website.

IMPORTANT: The Continent of Sobukand is in the Southern Hemisphere, so as you go farther south, the climate gets generally colder.

IMPORTANT: When using clothing inspired by a certain time period or people please be respectful of their cultures.  Do not use real world religious or ceremonial clothing as costuming. 

The Regions in our world are similar geographically or climate wise to locations in the real world.  We used those features when designing the Regions to allow us to offer as much variety in clothing options as possible. This also means that we do not need to reinvent the wheel for all costume designs which should lower the barrier to entry for costuming this larp.  The goal is to be inclusive rather than exclusionary. 

However, we must take great care to treat the real world cultures that inspire our Regions with respect.  *We reserve the right to ask you to modify your costuming if there is a perception of disrespect to a real world culture.* A little bit of research can go a long way to avoiding problems of this nature. 

Not sure if your costume might be cultural appropriation? Ask us! We are happy to review pictures of your costume or its components for you and if we aren't sure we can also ask others in the community to get a consensus. We may also have ideas of how to adjust existing pieces to be more appropriate.

# Northern Regions

The Northern Regions of Sobukand are generally warm and full of a wide variety of plant and animal life. The imperial capital city of Casere was located on a spot of land that most would have considered part of Feldland. This location, while technically in the north, was chosen for its proximity to trade routes between north and south and river access on the Micelburn. 

## Holthar

NOTE: If you do not see a background that makes sense for your character there are still options. Option 1 is to pick a Skill from the above list that you do like and simply share with us how your character learned that skill from their background.  Maybe instead of a carpenter they were a barrel maker or something like that. The important thing is that the background adds to your character's depth and gives you one skill from the above list. Option 2 is to propose a new background and skill pairing to the Directors and see if you get approval.



# Character Skills

## What are Skills?

Your character comes to Torakand possessing a number of skills, showing their expertise and talent, and can learn more as part of their adventures. You can make use of these skills in a number of ways. A skill will also list the prerequisites required to obtain that skill, as well as a description of the skill. A skill’s description will contain one or more tags, described below, which explain when, where, and how often a skill can be used. A full list of tags is available below. 

Some skills have multiple named benefits contained within one skill, called talents. These individual talents will have its own set of tags about when and how they can be used as needed.

In order to use a skill or talent within a skill, you simply need to perform the roleplaying described in the skill. Some will require you to specifically call out the name of the skill or talent to produce their effect. This call will be detailed in the description. If a skill or talent grants you an additional Save against a specific effect, you do not need to call anything other than “Save.” You can safely assume to use the most limited applicable save benefit you have first, as long as you take care to not exceed the total number of Saves you have available. 

If an injury or effect temporarily reduces your attributes below the requirements of the skill, you will not lose access to the skill. 

### Teaching and Learning New Skills

For every ten points of build your character spends they gain a new Skill Slot. A character who has an available Skill Slot or is about to obtain one from the Build spent this event may learn a new Skill. 

In order to learn a Skill, you must possess both the necessary attribute scores, as detailed on the Skill, as well as any pre-requisite skills needed. In order to learn the skill, you must find someone to teach you- either a Guild leader, key NPC, or another character who possesses that Skill. A lesson should take at least fifteen minutes of roleplay, and may be broken up in a series of discussions over the weekend. Once the Lesson is complete write on your character sheet the new skill name below your other skills.  The teacher may also have a quest to teach a skill, if so the player learning the skill can sign the quest card for the teacher.. If the teacher of the skill was another player, they may also gain a one Build Quest for teaching. You may only gain one learning or teaching-related quest per event, regardless of how many skills you teach or lessons you take. 

### Skills and Knowledge

Your character possesses a number of skills that govern different disciplines, fields of study, and abilities. Regardless of the source of a skill, you may freely assume that you possess an intellectual or academic understanding of any skill you possess, in addition to any knowledge the skill explicitly grants. For example, the Banner Bearer skill would include some knowledge of military parade and procedure, or Gunsmithing with the basic understanding of how gunpowder weapons operate, or the history of guns. In short, you know intellectually what you know how to do, and can ask the Storytellers based on these skills for additional information based on the skills you possess. To use this, you should work into the roleplaying conversation a phrase that clearly indicates your knowledge. For example: “As a Brightsmith do I recall some information about this candelabra?” or “As an alchemist I once did an experiment with a variety of soapstones, do these look familiar to me?”

### Skill Tags

* *Always*: A skill with this tag is either a passive effect that is always active, or describes an action that you can takes as many times as you wish. 
* *Once Per Rest*: A skill with this tag may be used once, and afterward cannot be used until your character completes a Rest. You may also spend a point of Grit to gain an additional use of any Once Per Rest skill. 
* *Once Per Event*: A skill with this tag can only be used Once Per Event, and may not be restored except by specific means. 
* *NPC Shift*: This is a benefit gained whenever your character completes an NPC shift. This includes the required NPC shift each event, as well as any voluntary shifts.   
* *Quest*: This is a skill that allows you and a number of others to complete a new kind of Quest. The skill will detail the most basic form of the Quest, and more valuable Quests of the same type may be available as the story continues. 
* *Gathering*: This skill is usable to gain a benefit  when Gathering resources. 
* *Crafting*: This skill allows you to complete Crafts or enhance the Crafts you currently know how to complete. 
* *Experimentation*: This skill’s benefits apply when performing Experimentation on an existing Craft.
