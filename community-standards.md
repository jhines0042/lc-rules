# Community Standards

Here at Lost Colonies Larp, we place the safety of our players and staff above all game considerations. We have established these safety and community standards to ensure that players have a safe, supportive, and comfortable experience. Both players and staff are expected to abide by these rules at all times, and anyone who fails to do so may face penalties, be dismissed from the game without a refund, or even - in particularly serious circumstances - be banned from Lost Colonies events indefinitely.

## Terminology

* *Player* - A person who attends our events
* *Marshal* - A player who has been approved by staff to make rules calls, supervise safety, and escalate issues to staff. Marshals are also players, and play player characters (PCs) at game 
* *Staff* - The directors and the storytellers of Lost Colonies Larp. They exclusively play as non-player characters (NPCs) and are present to support the story and community, but are still considered players.
* *Director* - The Directors are the owners of Lost Colonies. They have the final authority on all decisions.
* *Hold* - A safety word used to immediately stop action for an important reason. Holds are explained fully later in this section.
* *Scene* - A single encounter or a short, self-contained set of actions such as a battle, a conversation, a negotiation, or a crafting session. Whenever there is a significant change in the action this is considered a change of scenes. Additionally, a marshal or staff member may call "scene" to indicate a scene change.
* *Narration* - When a scene is narrated, it is described rather than acted out. This tool may be employed for various reasons, such as safety, availability of resources, or if a player chooses to opt out of active roleplay for any reason. Narration should only be used when necessary, as immersive roleplay is always preferable.

## Consent

At any time, players are free to opt out of a scene if they are uncomfortable, without IG or OOG repercussions. There are two tools a Player may use to indicate this: the Hold and the Lookdown.

If a player calls out “Hold,” everyone within earshot should immediately stop the scene. The player should identify why they called the hold and address what about the scene is making them uncomfortable. Marshals or other players present should try to reasonably adjust the scene to accommodate the player’s concerns. The player may still excuse themselves if they choose.

A Lookdown is when a player looks downward and shades their eyes with their hand, as one might do if the sun was in their eyes. The player should then (safely) back away and remove themselves from the scene. This opt-out method is best employed if a player does not wish to address their reasons for leaving and would rather excuse themselves immediately. Other players and staff are not to stop someone employing a lookdown or ask them to explain themselves.

If you opt out of a scene, especially with the lookdown method, consider taking a few minutes out of game to ensure your own emotional wellbeing. .If you see a player exit a scene for any reason, do not try to beg, cajole, bribe, hound, guilt trip, or otherwise pressure them to return to the scene.. 

Though these tools exist for personal wellbeing, a player cannot use this opt-out system as a way to avoid IG consequences their character may have incurred. Narration may be used to resolve a scene in a way that is acceptable for the player, and details of the scene may be tweaked to avoid causing the player distress, but players should always follow through on their character’s actions in a fair and reasonable way.

.If a Player decides to exit a scene for any reason, do not try to beg, cajole, bribe, hound, guilt trip, or otherwise attempt to convince them to return to the scene..

A Player may not, however, use lack of consent to avoid IG consequences that result from their Character’s own actions. In situations where a Player is not comfortable with acting out the repercussions of their actions, a Marshal should be found so that the scene can be narrated to a satisfactory conclusion in a manner that is comfortable for the Players involved (even if the results are not good for their Characters).

> Example: A player has a major fear of spiders, but their character has agreed to retrieve a special mineral from a cave. The character is ambushed by creatures that resemble spiders, but the player finds the scene too disturbing and uses the lookdown to leave the scene. The marshal running the scene may determine that the character has simply fled the cave without harm, but also without the minerals. If the player approaches the marshal later and wishes to resolve the scene, the marshal may narrate what happened in the cave to allow the player to roleplay as though their character remained present for the encounter. If appropriate, the marshal may describe the enemies as “bears” rather than spiders.

> Example: A player is afraid of tight spaces, but has decided to have their character infiltrate an ancient tomb. Everything is going fine until the rats attack. The space the combat is taking place in is too confining and the player calls a Hold. All activity should immediately stop. The player asks if the combat can be moved outside, or if the number of enemies can be reduced. The Marshal decides to reduce the number of enemies but increases their stats to accommodate and the scene continues. 

In either case, everyone present should return to IG interaction as soon as the situation has been resolved

## Consent to Contact and Personal Space

You should never encroach on another player’s personal space or touch them without their permission for any reason. There are verbal and non-verbal ways to achieve consent that make this consent simple to obtain without sacrificing immersion.

> Good Example: Player A extends their hand for a handshake, Player B shakes their hand. 

> Bad Example: Player A extends their hand for a handshake and Player B grabs and kisses Player A’s hand instead. In this example, Player A consented to a handshake, not a kiss, and Player B acted inappropriately.

> Good Example: Player A is lying in the infirmary tent with a (pretend) broken leg. Player B is playing a medic and wants to roleplay examining the leg. Player B asks “may I touch your leg to examine it?” while indicating with their hands that they mean to touch Player A’s leg. Player A is not comfortable with being touched and says “no.” or “please don’t touch it, it hurts.” Player B instead applies a poultice to some bandages for their roleplay, and Player A applies the bandages to themself.

## Quiet Room

Every event will have one location designated as a Quiet Room. The Quiet Room is meant for people who need to get away, relax, hydrate, maybe grab a granola bar, and sit down for a while. Please be respectful of everyone who is there.


## PG-13 Rating

The target content rating for our events is “PG-13.” We are not looking to police language or conversation topics (with the exception of the Off-Limits Topics below), but we strive for an environment that is not hostile, needlessly violent, or otherwise unpleasant, and we expect players to respect this.

## Off-Limits Topics

There are certain topics that are completely off limits. It does not matter who is involved in the scene or how the individuals present personally feel about these topics, Off-Limits Topics will never be present in this game for any reason.

. .No scenes will involve rape or sexual assault.
. .No scenes will involve slavery.
. .No stories will include genocide.

## Makeup and Skin Coloration

.No costume will include full face or body makeup that mimics a natural human skin tone.. All Ancestries or monsters that require face or body paint specify a color that is clearly not a real-world skin tone, such as purple, blue, or green. We recommend that any prosthetics applied as part of a costume or makeup be made to match your natural skin tone, or to match the non-natural skin paint specified for best effect.

## Accommodating Player Belief Systems

Just because we are all taking on the persona of imaginary people does not mean that our real world belief systems stop applying. Staff will always do their best to accommodate any religious necessities, and other players are expected to always be respectful of others’ sincerely held beliefs. That said, staff cannot anticipate all necessities, so if you need any form of special support, please let staff know how we can help and we will do everything we can to accommodate you. 
Furthermore, you may always incorporate any special garments or wearables associated with your religious beliefs into your costume, regardless of your character’s background, staff will never ask you to remove these items. If you need to take yourself OOG for prayer or other observances, you are welcome to do so without obstruction or penalty.

> Example: Cultural or religious head coverings may be worn IG and you never need to remove them. These kinds of head coverings are supported by the costuming standards and the lore and you are not limited to one particular Region of the world, either.

> Example: If you participate in daily observances of prayer at certain times, you are more than welcome to take yourself OOG and head to the Quiet Room or another safe location for the time you need.

This list of examples is not meant to be an exhaustive list.

## Accommodating Dietary Restrictions

If you have certain food restrictions, regardless of reason, please let us know at least one week in advance of the event. We will do our best to ensure that any food provided by the Lost Colonies Larp is appropriately labeled to alert of possible allergy concerns as well as vegetarian versus non-vegetarian choices. Advanced notice will make this easier on the staff.

## Accommodating Disability or Medical Needs

Lost Colonies will make every accommodation allowable by the facilities we use to support players with disabilities or special medical needs. While our events take place largely outdoors and involve certain aspects of physicality, we are happy to provide whatever support we can to make Lost Colonies inclusive to people with differing needs and abilities. If you need access to electricity,  or other support, please let staff know ahead of time and we will work with you. .No special permission is required to sleep Out-of-Game..

## Respecting Names and Genders

Players are expected to use and respect the names and pronouns of their fellow players. If you mistakenly use the wrong name or pronoun, quickly and unobtrusively correct yourself or politely accept correction from others, and then make a sincere effort to remember in the future. It is expected that simple mistakes may happen, but deliberate misgendering or ongoing failure to respect other players will be considered malicious, and will result in penalties or eventual removal from game.

Remember that players may also be playing a character of a different gender than themselves, so if you are unsure of someone’s preferences, whether in or out of game, find an opportunity to politely ask them, preferably in private.

## Combat Authorization

When you first attend an event, if you are 16 years of age or older, we will instruct you on safe combat and test you on key safety procedures. When you pass this test, we grant you Combat Authorization, which is good for one year. During the course of an event, if marshals or staff witness you being unsafe during combat, they may remove your Combat Authorization. To regain your Combat Authorization, you will need to repeat the safety instruction and pass the test
again.

## Hold and Clarify, or How to Pause the Game

.Hold.: Players and marshals may both use “Holds” to stop the game. Hold may be called for safety reasons, or so that a marshal or staff member may explain or narrate something. When calling a Hold, you must freeze in place and yell “Hold!” loud enough for everyone in the vicinity to hear you. If you hear someone else yell “Hold!,” you should also freeze and repeat it, to ensure everyone in the are can hear. Players in a Hold should also provide a visual indication of the Hold by either placing a closed fist on top of their head or holding a weapon on top of their head. Players should not approach a scene where a Hold has been called. Only staff or marshals may call a Hold to explain a scene, but any player can and should call a Hold if they believe there is a safety concern of any kind. If you have any suspicion that a player may be hurt or in danger, it is best to call a Hold, rather than risk harm to another person. Remember, safety is the most important aspect of larping!

.Clarify.: All players can call “Clarify” to ask another player or a staff member about a rule or effect. When calling Clarify, you should not shout it. Instead, say “Clarify” loudly enough for those within a ten-foot radius to hear. Players in the immediate area should pause to allow the uncertainty to be resolved without interruption. Additionally, the player who called Clarify should put a fist or weapon on their head to indicate that play is temporarily paused. If you use a skill and are asked to clarify, you should explain the skill you have used to the satisfaction of the other player.

.Lay On.: “Lay On” is called to indicate that the game may resume, usually preceded by a countdown to give warning (“3, 2, 1, Lay On”)

### Further Hold and Clarify Rules

When you use a Hold or Clarify, all IG effects pause until Lay On is called. During a Hold or Clarify, you cannot be targeted by anything IG, and any IG actions taken are ignored as though they never happened. Players may not use a Hold or Clarify to gain any kind of advantage or take any kind of action, this includes players who are not directly involved in the Hold or Clarify. Players must also stay in place so that marshals and the person who called the Hold may quickly assess and address the situation.

## Safety Check Hand Signals

If at any point you are concerned about another player, you can check their wellbeing without breaking immersion using the “safety check” signal. To initiate a “safety check,” make eye contact with another player and make an “OK” hand signal over your chest (with your thumb and index finger together to make a circle and your other fingers up). Once the other player has recognized the hand signal, they may respond in one of three ways: 

. A thumbs-up sign indicates that everything is going fine, and play can proceed. 
. A level-hand or “wishy washy” hand motion means that the player is uncertain. In this case, either excuse yourself and the other player from the scene or break the scene and ensure the other player is able to continue. Treat this as a thumbs-down until the player establishes that they are able to continue.
. A thumbs-down sign indicates that things are not OK. The checker should escort the other player away, give them the opportunity to excuse themself, or stop the scene entirely. Players exiting a scene should place a fist on their head or put on white headbands to indicate that they are going OOG. The player who has indicated that they are “not OK” should be given the opportunity to indicate what help they need. When in doubt, escort them to the Quiet Room. If you feel comfortable doing so, please report any serious issues to one or more of the marshals or the directors so we can help out as needed. 

If for some reason the Safety Check Hand Signal doesn’t work and you have a concern about the health or safety (including emotional safety) of another player, please call a Hold. If you are interacting with a Player who has a visual impairment, use an OOG vocal cue in addition to the Hand Signal. Say “Out of game: Safety Check. Are you okay?” At every event we will have identifiable staff members who are your first stop for safety issues. Any marshal or staff member will help you get to these designated individuals.

At times, you may think that another Player is having a rough time. Perhaps the scene has gotten more intense than usual, or the weather is hot and you are concerned about dehydration or any number of other reasons why you might want to subtly check in on another Player without breaking Character to do so. We have adopted a set of safety check hand signs designed to limit the break in immersion while allowing you to discreetly check in with other Players.

## Self Check

We believe that a good Larp community checks in on each other to ensure we are all happy and safe, but it is also useful to practice a “self-check” regularly. Throughout the event, pause to assess your own well-being to make sure you continue to enjoy your experience and care for your own emotional and physical needs. If you find yourself stressed or struggling to continue, ask yourself these questions:

* Have I had any water recently?
* Have I had enough to eat?
* Am I warm enough / cool enough?
* Are my socks dry?
* Have I injured anything?
* Have I had enough sleep?
* Have I been on my feet too long?
* Do I need to sit down and rest?
* Do I need some quiet?
* Am I emotionally well?


## Following the Rules


*Marshals and Staff Have Final Say*

It is impossible to anticipate every situation, and this rulebook cannot possibly cover every scenario that may arise. In any situation where the rules are in question, marshals and
staff are empowered to make judgment calls or adjudicate rules conflicts. A marshal’s decision always supersedes the written word of the rulebook, but never permanently sets a precedent. Marshals are empowered to “undo” player actions and reset part of a scene if they judge that a player has acted in a way inconsistent with the rules or their character’s abilities.

If a specific rule is found to be a source of problems or confusion, it should be brought to the staff’s attention, and may be adjusted for future events. A storyteller is also empowered to make rulings that affect a whole scene, as long as those rulings do not contradict the Safety and Community standards. To avoid long holdups in the game, please do not argue with marshals or storytellers when they make a ruling. After the scene is done, if you feel that the call was in error, please bring the concern to the directors along with the name of the staff involved in the call. The directors will review, make a final ruling, and may adjust the outcome or future outcomes as necessary.

The directors will always do their best to resolve conflicts to the satisfaction of all parties involved, but will keep fairness and the cooperative intent of the rules as their primary consideration. The ability to appeal to the directors should not be abused, and this option is not meant for Players to simply “go over the head” of a marshal because a decision did not benefit them personally. Directors will never alter a marshal’s decision solely because a player complains.

In most cases, rule-breaking is a genuine mistake or the result of simple misunderstanding, so trying to clear up this misunderstanding patiently is the best course of action. If a player is deliberately cheating or gaming the rules, however, they may detract from other players’ experiences and harm the cooperative aspects of the game. If you believe a player is breaking the rules, or if there is a disagreement about rules interpretation, promptly bring this to the attention of a marshal or other staff.

## Interpreting the Rules

Lost Colonies supports and rewards creative thinking and clever use of game mechanics, however players should never take advantage of this to cheat or look for loopholes. If you are unsure of how something is supposed to work, ask a staff member first. Do not “read between the lines,” make assumptions, or exploit vagueness or human error to gain an advantage or detract from other players’ experiences.


## IG vs. OOG Knowledge

Even for experienced players, it is never possible to fully separate what the player knows from what their character knows, but players must strive to avoid using out of game (OOG) knowledge that their character does not possess during gameplay. The intentional use of OOG knowledge to benefit a character is called metagaming.

The exception to this rule is character secrets. If you wish specifically to keep something a secret in-game, you are expected keep it a secret out of game as well. If a player knowingly shares a specific character secret with other players, even when shared away from the game space, then any player that hears that secret may consider it in-game (IG) knowledge at their discretion.

This exception may seem contradictory to the general rule on metagaming, but it’s simply a matter of practicality. It is almost impossible to fairly adjudicate a situation where players have a major, important piece of information, but must indefinitely pretend that they don’t. These circumstances lead to unintentional metagaming and may cause frustration and resentment. As such, if a player  shares a character secret with other players, it will be presumed that this knowledge was overheard or let slip within the setting of the game as well, and players will not be penalized for acting on that knowledge.

> Example of a Secret: Player A brags about killing a beloved NPC at a restaurant after the event when many other players are within earshot. This knowledge is important to the game, and players emotionally invested in this NPC continue to discuss this knowledge out of game, making it effectively common knowledge within the player base. If other players call for Player A’s arrest at the next game and claim that they heard a rumor of Player A’s guilt, this would not be considered a violation of the rules.

> Example of Meta-Gaming: Player Q overhead the storytellers talking and learned that NPC Bob is secretly a traitor. NPC Bob later approaches Player Q’s character and asks for help identifying a gemstone in a cave. With no apparent motive, Player Q asks for directions to the cave, then attacks and kills the NPC and goes to steal the gemstone. Since NPC Bob never gave any indication of being a traitor, Player Q’s character had no rational reason to murder them. This type of metagaming only diminishes the experience and may interfere with other peoples’ gameplay or with the story. As in all scenarios, Player Q has the option to simply refuse to help NPC Bob if they so choose, but in this case they abused their metagame knowledge.

Please note, however, that it is always ok to share character secrets with the directors and storytellers, as they do not play PCs and will keep your secrets in confidence.

If you find yourself in a situation where a small piece of OOG knowledge may help the scene move forward or enhance other players’ experience, use of that knowledge will not be penalized. For example, if players are lost on a quest and becoming frustrated, suggesting “maybe we should check in that field” because you happen to know the storytellers were there earlier is not an abuse of OOG information.

## Playing Npcs with Out-of-Game Knowledge

When you play as an NPC as part of your NPC shift you will necessarily be exposed to some behind-the-scenes knowledge. Players are expected to do their very best to always maintain story integrity by not letting knowledge gained on their NPC shift affect their character’s choices.

Whenever you play an NPC, your PC is to have no direct actionable knowledge of that NPC whatsoever. If other players discuss an NPC you have played, either as a full-time NPC or on your 4-hour shift, you should behave as though you are fairly disinterested in whatever they have to say about that NPC, and avoid engaging in discussion about them as much as possible. This is to prevent NPC knowledge becoming entangled with your PC’s knowledge.

## Rules Violations

Rules Violations are a mechanism to document player misconduct. Rules Violations are given to the player, not the character. If a marshal issues a Rules Violation, then it will be added to all Character Cards of the Player. Each Rules Violation will remain on the Character Cards for six events and are afterwards removed from the cards. If a player accumulates four Rules Violations, then they will be permanently banned from the game.

A marshal may only give a player one Rules Violation per incident, but a director may give a player multiple Rules Violations for one incident if they rule that a violation is especially severe. An incident is usually a single violation of the rules, but it may be a series of related violations - such as several dangerous actions during combat scene - that the marshal is resolving as part of one incident. A marshal may escalate an incident to a director if they feel that it needs to be addressed further, or if they feel it is severe enough to warrant more than one Rules Violation.

## Obeying the Law

Reality is not suspended at Larp. Anything that is illegal in reality is illegal during game. This includes but is not limited to harassment, use of illegal substances, trespassing, property damage, and assault. Furthermore, consumption of alcohol at ordinary game events is strictly prohibited, regardless of player’s age. Players found to be violating any law will be escorted off the premises immediately, banned from game indefinitely, and law enforcement may be called at the directors’ discretion.

## Zero Tolerance Policy for Discrimination

Lost Colonies strives to be a safe, supportive, and fully inclusive space for people of all genders, sexualities, races, religions, backgrounds, cultures, classes, abilities, and all other features that make the human race unique. There will be absolutely no tolerance for hate speech, discriminatory behavior, harmful caricature, mockery, or any other behaviors that victimize, harm or exclude anyone for any reason. Violation of this policy will be addressed by the directors and penalized with the appropriate severity. If you feel you have been the victim of discriminatory behavior from players or staff, please bring this to the attention of the directors immediately.
