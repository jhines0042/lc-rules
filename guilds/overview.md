# Guilds

Guild is a broad term that includes both the Civilian Guilds that make up the Flint Company’s structure as well as the Military Orders that make up the empire’s military apparatus.  For simplicity sake these are all called Guilds throughout the rules.

From a larp design perspective we want Guilds to be positive social groups. Occasionally guilds can come in to conflict with each other. Generally though we envision them working toward the common goals of the settlement collectively, even if they priorities those goals differently. Guilds also serve as a source of Quests for the characters to pursue and provide opportunities for them to learn new skills. Some of the most powerful skills in the game may not be as easily accessible without a good relationship with the right Guild. But guild are not supposed to be character defining, or even necessarily a permanent choice. They are meant to be something that you choose to dedicate time to, that help you cultivate an identity, not to be the sum of your identity. 

In short, If you see a skill or an ability that you would like to learn but which isn’t in your Guild, you can seek someone out who’s willing to teach it to you. However, if you keep taking skills outside of your Guild you’ll naturally be using those abilities and finding your priorities changing. When that happens frequently it may be time to talk to one of the Guild heads to see if a change is in order.

A Character starts as a member of one guild and may join up to one more guild.  Characters may leave guilds if their path in life has changed.

Each Guild may have more than one Path to take within it.  A Path is a series of skills that work together.  A path is not something you record on your Character sheet, rather it is a series of connected skills that have each other as prerequisites.  Simply put, they are an easy way to group skills together into a logical order of acquisition.  Some paths may be straight lines of prerequisites and others may branch like a tree.  Some paths will be shorter or longer than others.

> When the empresses announced that they planned to establish a Colony on Torakand, they requested that groups bid on the opportunity.  The Flint Colonial Company’s bid included some key features helping them win.  First, the company suggested that a military contingent be sent along to help determine a location acceptable to the empresses’ wishes.  Secondly, the company wished to select Colonists from all regions of Sobukand to ensure not only access to the most skilled Colonists, but also a diverse world view.  Lastly, the company had secured the most outside funding, having partnered with a few of the richer guilds from Terradinium.

> The military sent along one commander for each of six Military Orders.  The commanders were selected for their vast experience and loyalty to the empresses and the empire. The Terradinium guilds designed a simplified guild structure for the Flint Colonial Company to use. For each guild the company selected a guildmaster based on their abilities in their trade or craft, their ability to teach others, and their ability to recognize when the guild structure may need to adapt as the settlement grows.

What you will find below is a summary of the Military Orders and Civilian Guilds for the Colony of Flint.  Each Colonist must join one of these organizations when they arrive at Flint, where they will then receive specialized training.
