# Acquisitions Guild

The Acquisitions Guild is focused on commerce and collection of treasures from the new world of Torakand.  The best of these treasures are shipped home to Sobukand to be sold to wealthy investors.  These patrons will, in return, fund the continuation and expansion of the Colony.
