# Explorers Guild

These intrepid adventurers forge their way into the world for the admiration and brilliance of discovery. They live by their measurements, maps, and drive for the unknown.  The world is theirs to explore.

Explorers Guild members are also expected to seek out training from other guilds and are often seen training along side the Military Orders.
