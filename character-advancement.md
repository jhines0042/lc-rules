# Character Advancement

## Character Advancement

Characters who participate in Events and accomplish Quests will grow in power.  Lost Colonies measure character growth through
Build or Build points.  The sections below explain how to earn build and how to spend build to improve a character.

### How to Earn Build
Characters earn build for participating in Lost Colonies:

* Characters earn one Build point for attending an Event. 
* Characters earn Build points for completing Quests.  Some Quests may take multiple Events to complete.

Special cases to earn build

* An Admission ticket to a Lost Colonies Event entitles the Player to play one Character. A Player who has more than one Player Character (commonly called “Alts”) must pay an extra fee per additional Character.  Each additional Character thus paid for also earns the Attendance count and the one Build for attending.

* Players who miss an event (even events that occurred before they joined the larp) may pay for Events they missed, and earn the build they would have earned through attendance. This gives new players a way to "catch up" with existing players.  Players who pre-pay for future Events will earn the attendance credit for those Events once the Event has occurred. 

### Spending Build
Characters can spend Build to improve their character.  

* Each Build point increases a Primary Attribute by one. Inform a LC storyteller that you wish to spend build and which attribute(s) you want to improve.
* After raising the attribute the storyteller will recalculate your character's Secondary Attributes. An increase in Primary
Attributes may result in incresaed Hit Points, Saves, Grit, or an additional Skill Slot.  (Remember that the number of skills is
based on the sum of the Primary Attributes; every tenth Attribute point will grant an additional Skill Slot.)
* If a Character earns a Skill Slot, the Player should choose a Skill from the list of skills appropriate for that character.
Characters should choose new skills from the skill lists for their Region, Background, and Guild(s).  Assuming the Character meets all of the prerequisites for the chosen Skill, the Character learns the Skill and it will be on their character sheet at the start of the next Event. Skills chosen during an Event are not available until the next Event. This is to prevent people from basing Skill choices off of the theme for an Event and gaining an advantage as a result.

Individual Skills may also be improved over time.  If your Character meets the prerequisite for an Improved version of a skill then you may spend time at an Event training to gain the Improved version.  At the end of the Event make a note on your character sheet that you should gain the Improved version and it will be available on your character sheet at the next Event.  You may only improve one skill per Event.  The Improved version will replace the previous version of the skill on your sheet and counts for prerequisite purposes the same as the skill it replaced.

### Limits on spending build 

* Characters may earn build without limit, but Characters may not spend more Build than six times the number of Events that Character has attended.

### Service Points

*  At some point in the future Lost Colonies will publish rules to reward service to the game with Build.
