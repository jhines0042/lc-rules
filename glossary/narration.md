* *[Narration](oEm3GEriSBaXdhj4NAI-cw)* - When a scene is narrated, it is described rather than acted out. This tool may be employed for various reasons, such as safety, availability of resources, or if a player chooses to opt out of active roleplay for any reason. Narration should only be used when necessary, as immersive roleplay is always preferable.
