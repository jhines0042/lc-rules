* *[Scene](mmyodpgBRqauELyd53FT6g)* - A single encounter or a short, self-contained set of actions such as a battle, a conversation, a negotiation, or a crafting session. Whenever there is a significant change in the action this is considered a change of scenes. Additionally, a marshal or staff member may call "scene" to indicate a scene change.
